History

I created the NovaCut font about 14-15 years ago for making inscriptions in
stone. Initially the font contained only capitals and digits and existed only
on paper and stone inscriptions. In 2010 I decided transfer this font
to a computer, and made the missing lowercase and some basical signs;
it was initially named Gothica.

By the way I made other versions of some letters. It was a lot of this at the
end of my work. I decided create new fonts based on these letters. And finally
I created six fonts family and named these fonts Nova (NovaCut, NovaFlat,
NovaOval, NovaRound, NovaSlim, NovaSquare - by the shape of individual fonts).
At last I created monospace font - NovaMono - the seventh part of this family.

NovaScript is based on my NovaOval font, and it's a part of the Nova set.
I created it because the Nova family was missing an oblique font. Now I consider
the Nova family complete.

This release contains only seven fonts, without 'Nova Mono'.
